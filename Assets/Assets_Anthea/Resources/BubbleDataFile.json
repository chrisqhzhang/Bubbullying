If you're looking to expand your knowledge and live a healthier lifestyle, you're in luck.\n\nRight now, she mostly stream single-player games. She does a ton of research beforehand and talks about the cultural and historical context of the game while playing - but it never feels like a boring lecture.",

I’m a few years younger than Goo, so I never interacted with her directly, but this is what I’ve heard from people who did. Take it with a grain of salt.\n\nFirst off, something confirmed: Goo was a Master student at Caltech University but didn’t graduate. She dropped out during her final year, so it’s hard to notice the gap just based on timing.\n\nGoo got into gaming because of her boyfriend at the time. It started as casual fun, but during her last year in school, she got pretty hooked. That said, gaming wasn’t the only thing; she barely showed up at her lab or even her apartment—most of her time was spent at bars.\n\nEventually, she and her boyfriend broke up, and not long after, she decided to drop out. Fun fact (or not so fun, depending on how you see it): the ex reportedly ended up in rehab for substance abuse later on.\n\nAfter dropping out, Goo had a rocky relationship with her family and didn’t keep in touch with them much. This probably means she wasn’t getting financial support from home, and back then, her streaming income was next to nothing (probably still isn’t much now). Kinda makes you wonder how she was covering her expenses during that time.\n\nThat’s about all the significant stuff. There’s some wilder rumors out there, but I’m not buying them, so I’ll leave them out.",
